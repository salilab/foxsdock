FoXSDock is a method for docking with SAXS profile of the complex.
The input is two proteins and a SAXS profile of their complex. The output is a list of potential complexes sorted by a score that combines interface energy and the fit to SAXS profile.

The docking protocol involves five steps (Fig. 1):

<ol>
<li> Global search. Rigid docking is performed by a geometric shape-matching algorithm PatchDock [1-2], generating thousands of models. In this step, the flexibility is taken into account implicitly by allowing a small amount of steric clashes at the interface.

<li> Coarse SAXS filtering. Radius of gyration predicted from the SAXS profile of the complex is used to filter out rigid docking models that do not agree with the SAXS measurements[3].

<li> SAXS scoring. Each docking model is fitted against the SAXS profile of the complex using FoXS method [4].

<li> Clustering. Remaining docking models are clustered by their interface C&alpha; RMSD and the cluster representative with the best fit to the SAXS profile is selected.

<li> Conformational refinement. Cluster representatives are refined and steric clashes are removed through optimization of side chain positions and relative protein orientations, with FireDock [5]. The final models are scored and ranked by an energy-based score and the fit to the SAXS profile.

</ol>
