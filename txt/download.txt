<p>The FoXSDock web server is a simple frontend to the <tt>idock</tt> program
which is part of the <a href="https://integrativemodeling.org/">IMP</a>
software package. Equivalent docking can thus be performed by
<a href="https://integrativemodeling.org/download.html">downloading IMP</a>
and then running <tt>idock</tt>.</p>

<p>The source code of this web service itself is also
<a href="https://github.com/salilab/foxsdock">available on GitHub</a>.
